[2025-07-29 22:52:53,314] 157 tensorflow - WARNING - 5 out of the last 17 calls to <function TensorFlowTrainer.make_predict_function.<locals>.one_step_on_data_distributed at 0x000002812B40DC60> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.
