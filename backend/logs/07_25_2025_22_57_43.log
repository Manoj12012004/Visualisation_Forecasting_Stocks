[2025-07-25 23:01:51,288] 157 tensorflow - WARNING - 5 out of the last 7 calls to <function TensorFlowTrainer.make_predict_function.<locals>.one_step_on_data_distributed at 0x0000024E10F83240> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.
